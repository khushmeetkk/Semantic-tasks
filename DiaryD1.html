    <h1>DAY 1</h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Introduction to HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>Today we started learning about the basics of HTML and CSS. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure content on the web, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and layout.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Basics of HTML</h2>
        <p>We covered foundational HTML elements such as paragraphs, headings, lists, tables, and forms. These elements are essential for structuring and organizing content on web pages.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Semantic Web</h2>
        <p>The semantic web refers to adding meaning and context to web content using semantic HTML tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>. This improves accessibility, SEO, and machine readability of web pages.</p>
        <p>Using semantic HTML helps search engines understand the structure of your content better, which can lead to improved search engine rankings and a better user experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
        <h2>GitHub and GitHub Pages</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to manage and track changes to their code, facilitating teamwork and project management.</p>
        <p>GitHub Pages is a feature of GitHub that allows you to publish static websites directly from a GitHub repository. By simply pushing your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a specific branch (usually the <code>gh-pages</code> branch), your website becomes accessible via a URL formatted like <code>https://username.github.io/repository</code>.</p>
        <p>Today, we also tried to work on GitHub, creating web pages and pushing our HTML and CSS files to a GitHub repository to see our work live on the web.</p>
